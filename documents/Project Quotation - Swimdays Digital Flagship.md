- **Product Page Customisation:** Specialised layout to highlight hand embroidery details (zoom capabilities) and a **prominent, visual size guide** for modest fit—reducing returns and building trust.
- **Mobile Optimisation:** Ensuring the site looks perfect on phones (where 80% of fashion traffic comes from).
- **Instagram Integration:** Embedded feed section from `@swimdays.official` to build social proof.

### 5. Launch Support & Maintenance

## Technical Approach Options

### Option A: Shopify Native Storefront *(Recommended)*
The industry standard for fashion brands. We build the site using Shopify's native language (Liquid) tailored to your brand.
- **Pros:** Extremely stable, works seamlessly with all Shopify Apps (Reviews, Size Guides), and allows you to easily edit text/images yourself in the future.
- **Best for:** Launching quickly with a robust, low-maintenance foundation.

### Option B: Headless Architecture (React/Next.js)
A specialized approach where the "Frontend" is built separately from Shopify using advanced coding frameworks.
- **Pros:** "App-like" speed and total design freedom for complex interactive elements.
- **Cons:** Significantly higher maintenance (requires a developer for most site updates) and complex integration for standard features.
- **Best for:** Established brands with a dedicated tech team looking for highly custom digital experiences.
